## Core Principles (Always Enforce)

### 1. Match the User's Language
**Detect the language of the user's message and respond entirely in that same language.** This is not optional — it overrides the default English behavior of all commands. If the user writes in Vietnamese, ALL output must be in Vietnamese. If in French, respond in French. If in English, respond in English. This applies to everything: explanations, questions, gate prompts, debug reports, summaries, and PR descriptions. Only code syntax, variable names, file paths, and command names (e.g., `/spartan:debug`) stay in their original form.

### 2. Spec Before Code
- Task < 1 day → `/spartan:spec` + `/spartan:plan` + `/spartan:build`
- Task > 1 day → `/spartan:project new` or `/spartan:project milestone-new`
- Never write production code without a written spec or plan

### 3. TDD is Non-Negotiable
- Red → Green → Refactor, always
- Write tests first, then the code that makes them pass

### 4. Atomic Commits
Each commit = one task, tests passing:
```
type(scope): what changed

- why / detail
```
Types: `feat` · `fix` · `test` · `refactor` · `chore` · `docs`

### 5. Context Hygiene (Auto-Managed)
Claude proactively manages its own context window:
- When detecting context pressure (slow responses, forgetting earlier context, long conversation) → auto-run `/compact` to summarize and free space
- If compaction isn't enough → auto-save critical state to `.handoff/` and `.memory/`, then tell user to start a fresh session
- User can also manually trigger `/spartan:context-save` at any time
- Session > 60% → hard stop, no exceptions
- State is in `.planning/` (GSD), `.memory/` (permanent), or `.handoff/` (session), never in chat history

**Self-monitoring signals** (Claude watches for these in its own behavior):
- Starting to lose track of earlier decisions → compact NOW
- Repeating questions already answered → compact NOW
- Response quality dropping → warn user + compact
- Multi-step command taking unusually long → consider compacting between steps

### 6. Auto Mode
When user says **"auto on"** or **"auto mode"**, all Spartan commands skip confirmation prompts and execute straight through. Claude will:
- Show the spec/plan/output but NOT pause to ask "does this match?" or "shall I proceed?"
- Continue to the next step automatically after each step completes
- Still STOP for destructive actions (git force push, dropping tables, deleting files)
- Still SHOW output at each step (user can interrupt with "stop" or "wait")

Turn off with **"auto off"**. Default is **auto off** (commands ask for confirmation).

Auto mode is ideal for experienced users who trust the workflow and want maximum velocity.

### 7. Safety Guardrails

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/spartan:careful` | Warn before destructive ops (rm -rf, DROP, force-push) |
| `/spartan:freeze <dir>` | Lock edits to one directory only |
| `/spartan:guard <dir>` | Both combined. Deactivate with `off` or `/spartan:unfreeze` |

## Core Commands (always available)

### Feature Workflow
```
/spartan:epic → /spartan:spec → [/spartan:design] → /spartan:plan → /spartan:build → /spartan:pr-ready
                     ↑                ↑                   ↑              ↑ + 3.5           ↑
                   Gate 1        Design Gate            Gate 2         Gate 3            Gate 4
```

| Size | Path |
|---|---|
| Single feature (backend) | `/spartan:spec` → `/spartan:plan` → `/spartan:build` |
| Single feature (with UI) | `/spartan:spec` → `/spartan:design` → `/spartan:plan` → `/spartan:build` |
| Batch of features (1-2 weeks) | `/spartan:epic` → then spec/plan/build each feature |
| Multi-week project | `/spartan:project new` → milestones + phases |

### Workflows (start here)
| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/spartan` | **Smart router** — routes to the right workflow or command |
| `/spartan:build [backend\|frontend] "feature"` | Full feature workflow: understand → plan → TDD → review → PR |
| `/spartan:debug "symptom"` | Bug workflow: reproduce → investigate → fix → review → PR |
| `/spartan:onboard` | Codebase understanding: scan → map → setup |

### Spec & Plan (saved artifacts)
| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/spartan:spec "feature"` | Write a feature spec → saves to `.planning/specs/` → Gate 1 |
| `/spartan:plan "feature"` | Write implementation plan from spec → saves to `.planning/plans/` → Gate 2 |
| `/spartan:epic "name"` | Break big work into ordered features → saves to `.planning/epics/` |

### Quality Gates
| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/spartan:gate-review [phase]` | Dual-agent review (Gate 3.5) — builder + reviewer must both accept |

### Individual Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/spartan:pr-ready` | Pre-PR checklist + auto PR description |
| `/spartan:daily` | Standup summary from git log |
| `/spartan:init-project` | Auto-generate CLAUDE.md from codebase |
| `/spartan:context-save` | Manage context: compact first, full save if needed |
| `/spartan:update` | Upgrade Spartan to latest version |
