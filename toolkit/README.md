# Spartan AI Toolkit

> Workflow-first engineering discipline for AI coding tools. Workflows solve problems end-to-end. Skills provide knowledge at each step. Agent memory carries context across sessions.

---

## Install

Three ways to install. Pick one.

### Option 1: npx (recommended)

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest
```

Interactive menu — pick your AI tool and packs. Works out of the box.

```bash
# Or specify packs directly
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --packs=backend-micronaut,product

# Install everything
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --all

# Install for Cursor instead of Claude Code
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --agent=cursor
```

**Supported agents:** `claude-code` (default), `cursor`, `windsurf`, `codex`, `copilot`

### Option 2: Setup script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spartan-stratos/spartan-ai-toolkit.git
cd spartan-ai-toolkit/toolkit
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh --global
```

### Option 3: Claude Code plugin

Search for **"Spartan AI Toolkit"** in the Claude Code plugin marketplace.

### Global vs Local

- `--global` installs to `~/.claude/` — works across all projects (default)
- `--local` installs to `./.claude/` — only this project

After install, open any project, run `claude`, then type `/spartan`.

## How to Use

### The core workflow

Every feature follows the same pipeline. Skip steps that don't apply.

```
/spartan:spec → /spartan:ux → /spartan:plan → /spartan:build → /spartan:pr-ready
      ↑             ↑               ↑              ↑ + 3.5           ↑
    Gate 1     Design Gate       Gate 2          Gate 3           Gate 4
```

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| `spec` | Interactive Q&A &rarr; saved spec &rarr; Gate 1 checks quality |
| `design` | Design doc + dual-agent review (skip for backend-only) |
| `plan` | Architecture + task breakdown from spec &rarr; Gate 2 |
| `build` | TDD task by task, picks up saved spec/plan |
| `gate-review` | Builder + reviewer agent both must accept |
| `pr-ready` | Rebase, test, lint, create PR |

**Bigger work?** Use `/spartan:epic` to break it into features first, then run the pipeline for each one. For multi-week projects, use `/spartan:project new` with milestones and phases.

**Skills load automatically** based on your stack. Kotlin files &rarr; `kotlin-best-practices`. React components &rarr; `ui-ux-pro-max`. Migrations &rarr; `database-patterns`. You don't pick them.

**Agent memory** (`.planning/`, `.memory/`) carries specs, plans, decisions, and patterns across sessions. The AI builds on what it already knows instead of starting from scratch.

**Rules** load every session with zero tokens. They enforce coding standards silently.

---

## Pick Your Packs

Packs group commands, rules, skills, and agents by use case. **Core is always installed.** Pick the rest based on what you're building.

### "I'm building a Kotlin + Micronaut backend"

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --packs=backend-micronaut
```

This pulls in `backend-micronaut` + its dependencies (`database` and `shared-backend` auto-included). You get migration commands, API design rules, Kotlin coding standards, test patterns, and two expert agents.

### "I'm building a React + Next.js frontend"

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --packs=frontend-react
```

You get Next.js scaffolding, Figma-to-code, E2E testing setup, frontend review, and the UI/UX design skill.

### "Full-stack Kotlin + Next.js"

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --packs=backend-micronaut,frontend-react
```

### "I'm managing AWS infrastructure with Terraform"

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --packs=infrastructure
```

You get Terraform scaffolding (ECS + EKS), module creation, security audits, drift detection, cost optimization, and two infrastructure agents. Rules enforce naming, state management, provider placement, and security patterns.

### "I'm running a multi-week project"

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --packs=backend-micronaut,project-mgmt
```

Adds project lifecycle, phases, workstreams, and GSD v5 wave execution on top of your backend tools.

### "I'm exploring startup ideas"

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --packs=research
```

Research pack pulls in `product` as a dependency. You get brainstorming, validation, market research, competitor teardowns, pitch materials, and investor outreach.

### "Give me everything"

```bash
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --all
```

## Using with Other AI Tools

All content is standard markdown. The npx installer supports multiple agents:

```bash
# Cursor — installs rules to .cursor/rules/
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --agent=cursor

# Windsurf — installs rules to .windsurf/rules/
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --agent=windsurf

# Codex — installs to .codex/
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --agent=codex

# Copilot — installs to .github/copilot/
npx @c0x12c/spartan-ai-toolkit@latest --agent=copilot
```

For other tools, copy the rule files from `toolkit/rules/` into your tool's config directory.

---

## Parallel Builds

By default, `/spartan:build` creates a **git worktree** per feature — a separate directory with its own branch. This means you can build 2+ features in parallel from different terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1                          # Terminal 2
claude                                claude
> /spartan:build auth                 > /spartan:build payments
# → .claude/worktrees/feature-auth/   # → .claude/worktrees/feature-payments/
# → PR #1                            # → PR #2
```

No conflicts. Each session gets its own worktree, branch, and PR.

To disable worktrees (single-terminal mode), set `worktree: false` in `.spartan/build.yaml`.

---

## Project Config

Customize any Spartan command per project. Two config files in `.spartan/`:

### `.spartan/build.yaml` — Build workflow config

Controls `/spartan:build` behavior:

```yaml
worktree: true              # git worktree per feature (default: true)
branch-prefix: "feature"    # branch name: [prefix]/[slug]
max-review-rounds: 3        # review-fix cycles before asking user
skip-stages: []             # skip: spec, design, plan, ship (never review)
worktree-symlinks: []       # extra dirs to share across worktrees

prompts:
  spec: |
    Always include performance requirements.
  plan: |
    Every task must reference a Jira ticket.
  implement: |
    Add structured logging to new service methods.
  review: |
    Check all API responses include request_id.
  ship: |
    PR title: [PROJ-123] Short description.
```

### `.spartan/commands.yaml` — Per-command prompt injection

Inject custom instructions into ANY Spartan command:

```yaml
prompts:
  review: |
    Flag any function longer than 50 lines.
  pr-ready: |
    Always add "Reviewers: @backend-team" for backend changes.
  daily: |
    Include blockers section. Tag by project area.
  debug: |
    Always check CloudWatch logs first.
  migration: |
    Migration files must start with ticket number.
```

Templates for both files are in `toolkit/templates/`.

## Target Stack

Rules and skills are tuned for this stack, but the command framework works with anything:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Kotlin + Micronaut |
| Frontend | React + Next.js + TypeScript |
| Infrastructure | Terraform + AWS (EKS/ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, S3) |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

> **Different stack?** Fork the repo, edit the rules and skills, run the installer. Commands work with any language or framework.
